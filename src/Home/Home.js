                Syrian Christian Seminary Higher Secondary School Thiruvalla,
                started as a boys’ elementary school way back in 1902 with a
                mission has now blazed it’s trail majestically to a widely
                acclaimed co-educational higher secondary institution and marked
                it’s name boldly in golden letters in the educational history of
                Kerala. Now spread across a vast area with premium modern

                curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities and

                the city, it is quite easy for the children to come over to the
                school and the campus is absolutely an enchanting abode for
                them. The astounding feature of the school is the tradition and
                the value oriented education which is being followed right

                It’s all a privilege to be a part of this educational
                institution and be the successor of so many pioneer pillars of
                administration who have proved their vibrant mettle in the field
                of education. Thousands of students paved their way with tiny
                legs through the sands of this campus and sailed successfully
                into the wuthering heights of various social domains. The

                bringing up the educational standards to a higher level and is
                still going on relentlessly. I know that the saga will continue

                School Thiruvalla will definitely scrap the sky forever.

                The SC Seminary hill has proved that it is truly the centre of
                education in Central Travancore for more than a century. The
                green rich campus, the prestigious Gothic style educational
                castle, the huge playground and the long high school and higher
                secondary buildings, the boarding home and all blended perfectly
                into this portrait to form an incredible art of educational
                complex. How glad I am, after securing the professional
                graduation for education from the same campus, finally been
                elated as the headmistress of this school. A huge number of
                eminent personalities shared their cheers and tears here and
                still keeping those nostalgic memories in their mind brightly.
                It’s a fortune I spend my glorious moments here both as a
                teacher and as a headmistress.
